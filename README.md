# Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to be able to determine the ammount of emplyees that will be retiring in the neat future. This is to be able to get a good idea, of how much hiring will be needed and also to determine retiring funds such as 401k, pensions etc.

## Results:

- On of the mayor points that we were trying to see with this exercise was to determine which positions were going to become vacant with the older people retiring.

-They needed to see which title are the most unique ones that will have to be filled in the coming years.

- Employees that were born during a certain period of time will qualify for some mentorship.

## Summary:

Looks like 90,398 titles will be retiring.


There are about 1500, mentorship eligible employees. In my opnion this will be enough to mentor all the new people coming in if there are phases to the hiring process.
